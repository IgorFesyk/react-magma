# Getting Started with Patterns

Patterns are opinionated, advanced components composed of React Magma components.

Each pattern is installed as individual packages, separate from component library, `react-magma-dom`. They also can serve as examples of how to combine React Magma components together in your application.

## Installation

### Setup Requirements

1. Your project needs to be running **React v16.5** or greater
2. `react-magma-icons` and `react-magma-dom` must be installed as peer dependencies

### Install the Pattern

Install the desired pattern with `npm`.

```sh title noRender noCodeSandbox
npm install --save @cengage-patterns/header
```

Install peer dependencies

```sh title noRender noCodeSandbox
npm install --save \
    "@emotion/core@10.0.35" \
    "@emotion/styled@10.0.27" \
    "date-fns@2.16.0" \
    "downshift@5.4.7" \
    "react@16.13.1" \
    "react-dom@latest" \
    "react-magma-icons@latest" \
    "uuid@8.3.0"
```

## Basic Usage

To use a pattern, simply import the component and add it to your UI. The styles are already bundled with the component.

Here is a basic example of the `Header` pattern:

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { Header } from '@cengage-patterns/header';

function Example() {
  return (
    <Header
      isInverse
      isCompact
      logo={<strong>LOGO</strong>}
      searchProps={{ onSearch: () => {} }}
    />
  );
}
```
