# Buttons

### Buttons are clickable items used to perform an action.

## Usage
Buttons communicate actions that users can take.

* Submit a form.
* Begin a new task.
* Trigger a new UI element to appear on the page.
* Specify a new or next step in a process.

### Principles
#### Identifiable
Buttons should indicate that they can trigger an action.

#### Findable
Buttons should be easy to find among other elements, including other buttons.

#### Clear
A button’s action and state should be clear.

### Styles
Magma includes several predefined button styles, each serving its own semantic purpose, with a few extras thrown in for more control.

<Playground>
    <p>
        <Button text="Default" />
        <Button type="primary" text="Primary" />
        <Button type="success" text="Success" />
        <Button type="warning" text="Warning" />
        <Button type="danger" text="Danger" />
    </p>
</Playground>

## Hierarchy and placement

### Hierarchy

#### A single, prominent button

A layout should contain a single prominent button that makes it clear that other buttons have less importance in the hierarchy. This high-emphasis button commands the most attention.

#### Other buttons

An app can show more than one button in a layout at a time, so a high-emphasis button can be accompanied by medium- and low-emphasis buttons that perform less important actions. When using multiple buttons, ensure the available state of one button doesn’t look like the disabled state of another.

### Placement

Multiple button types can be used to express different emphasis levels.
