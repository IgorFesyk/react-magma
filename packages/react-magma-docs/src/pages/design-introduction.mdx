# Designing with React Magma

React Magma is a visual language allowing the designers at Cengage to easily create consistent solutions, and spend more time exploring creative solutions to the problems our students and instructors face.

## Principles

### Simplicity

Take complex problems and design the simplest and most valuable solutions using good design principles and easy to learn design patterns.

### Consistency

Use components consistently across products to reduce the cognitive load placed on students and instructors.

### Accessible

Use color and design patterns that meet the WCAG requirements set by the W3C, so that all students and instructors can share in the value our products bring to education.
