# Getting Started with React Magma

Install the React Magma component library, and start using Cengage-themed, accessible components in your application.

For more information, including information on contributing to React Magma and running the project locally, visit the [Stash repository](http://stash.corp.web:7990/projects/FRONT/repos/react-magma/browse).

## Installation

### Setup Requirements

1. Your project needs to be running **React v16.5** or greater
2. Make sure you have a `.npmrc` file and are using http://nexus.mindtap.corp.web/content/groups/npm.group/ as your registry.
3. Icons must be installed as a peer dependency

```sh
registry=http://nexus.mindtap.corp.web/content/groups/npm.group/
```

### Install the Component Library

Install the React Magma Component library with `npm`.

```sh
npm install --save react-magma-dom
```

Install peer dependencies

```sh
npm install --save \
    "@emotion/core@10.0.35" \
    "@emotion/styled@10.0.27" \
    "date-fns@2.16.0" \
    "downshift@5.4.7" \
    "react@16.13.1" \
    "react-dom@16.13.1" \
    "react-magma-icons@1.0.2" \
    "uuid@8.3.0"
```

## Icons Only

The Icon library is not dependent on react-magma being used. `react-magma-icons` can be used independently by installing the package as a dependency in your project.

```sh
npm install --save react-magma-icons
```

## Known Issues

1. `Legacy context API has been detected within a strict-mode tree` - https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/3487
