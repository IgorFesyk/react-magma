# Using React Magma

How to use React Magma components. The examples here use the <Link to="/api/button">Button</Link> component. More information about each of the components can be found in the Component API section.

## Basic Usage

To use a component, simply import the component and add it to your UI. The styles are already bundled with the component.
Here is a most basic example:

```.js
 import React from 'react'
  import { Button } from 'react-magma-dom'

  function Demo() {
    return <Button>Hello World</Button>
  }
```

This would render as:

<Button>Hello World</Button>

## Using TypeScript Enums

When using a prop that takes an enum, you must import that type from React Magma if you are using TypeScript.

```.js
 import React from 'react'
  import { Button, ButtonVariant } from 'react-magma-dom'

  function Demo() {
    return <Button variant={ButtonVariant.outline}>Hello World</Button>
  }
```

This would render as:

<Button variant="outline">Hello World</Button>

## Importing Global Styles

Most of the styles for React Magma are bundled within their components. However, a `GlobalStyles` object is available, which provides a
very basic CSS reset plus the required fonts, body styles, and some generic styles for links. It is recommended that you use this `GlobalStyles` component in any app that uses React Magma
to insure consistency across products.

To use the `GlobalStyles` object, simply import it from `react-magma-dom` and include it in your App.

The `GlobalStyles` component can be nested inside the <Link to="/api/theme">ThemeContext.Provivder</Link> to inherit styles from the theme.

```.js
 import React from 'react'
  import { GlobalStyles } from 'react-magma-dom'

  function App() {
    return <div>
      <GlobalStyles />
    </div>
  }
```

## Using the Magma Theme

React Magma uses the Magma theme for styles, which includes fonts, colors and screen sizes for media queries. To remain consistent,
you can import `magma` and reference these values in your application's styles.

The complete Magma theme can be found in the [Stash repository](http://stash.corp.web:7990/projects/FRONT/repos/react-magma/browse/packages/react-magma-dom/src/theme/magma.ts).
For more information about colors, see the <Link to="/design/colors">Design Documentation</Link>.

```.js
 import React from 'react'
  import { magma } from 'react-magma-dom'
  import styled from '@emotion/styled';

  function Demo() {

    const StyledDiv = styled.div`
      background: ${magma.colors.neutral};
      color: ${magma.colors.neutral08};
    `;

    return <StyledDiv>
      Hello world
    </StyledDiv>
  }
```

## Testing

We recommend using [jest](https://jestjs.io/) with [`@testing-library/react`](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro).

Wherever possible selecting elements should be handled using visible text or aria-labels with the `@testing-library/react` queries for `text` and `labelText`. If there are multiple elements that are returned from a query you can refine the results using the [`SelectorMatcherOptions`](https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library/blob/19901e13b6acd11df580ddf6dd35540a39c5eaaf/types/query-helpers.d.ts#L4) in your query.

If that is not sufficient, each of our components accept a `testId` that is passed to the primary element as a `data-testid` attribute that can be found with the `getByTestId` helper function from `@testing-library/react`.
