# Global Styles

The `GlobalStyles` component should be included at the top of your application to provide global css, including the required fonts,
body styles, and some generic styles for links and headings.  

The `GlobalStyles` component can be nested inside the <Link to="/api/theme">ThemeContext.Provivder</Link> to inherit styles from the theme.

```.jsx
  <GlobalStyles />
```
