<DocsHeading type="api">Skip Link</DocsHeading>

Because the main content is often not the first thing on a page, it is valuable to provide a Skip Navigation link
to allow users who navigate via keyboard and/or screen reader to jump directly to the content.

Because the `SkipLink` and `SkipLinkContent` work based on an `id`, it is important that you only have one pair of these elements on a page.

## Basic Usage

The `SkipLink` component is the button that will jump the user to the main content area. It should be the first item in your app, positioned in the DOM before the navigation and the content.
Users will not see the component unless they are navigating by keyboard.

The `SkipLinkContent` component is the div that is the target of the `SkipLink`. It can either be used as a wrapper for your content, or as a sibling of your content.
If there is an h1 heading inside the SkipLinkContent, the h1 will receive focus. Otherwise, just the SkipLinkContent div itself will get focus.

```
<div>
  <SkipLink />
  <YourNav />
  <SkipLinkContent>
    <YourContent />
  </SkipLinkContent>
</div>
```

Or

```
<div>
  <SkipLink />
  <YourNav />
  <SkipLinkContent />
  <YourContent />
</div>
```

When the user tabs to the first element, a hyperlink with this appearance will display in focus:

<Button>Skip Navigation</Button>

## Button Variations

By default, the `SkipLink` looks like a standard button with `color` as`primary`, `variant` as `solid`, and `isInverse` as false.

Variants for buttons include `solid`, `outline`, and `link`.
Colors for buttons include `primary`, `secondary`, `success`, and `danger`.
IsInverse is can be either `true` or `false`, and is used when the SkipLink is to appear on a dark background.

For more information, see the <Link to="/api/button">Button Component documentation</Link>.

```
<SkipLink
  color="success"
  variant="outline" />
```

This would render the button as:

<Button color="success" variant="outline">
  Skip Navigation
</Button>

## Button Text

By default, the text inside the button says "Skip Navigation". This can be overridden using the `buttonText` prop.

```
<SkipLink
  buttonText='Skip to main content' />
```

This would render the button as:

<Button>Skip to main content</Button>

## Positioning

By default, the `SkipLink` is fixed positioned 10px from the top and 10px from left of the screen. This can be customized using the optional `positionLeft`
and `positionTop` properties, which take numeric values.

```
<SkipLink
  positionLeft={25}
  positionTop={25} />
```

This would render the button 25px from the top, and 25px from the left of the browser window.

## Skip Link Props

**This component uses `forwardRef`. The ref is applied to the `a` element.**

All of the [standard anchor attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) can be provided as props and will be applied to the `a` element that gets rendered.

<SkipLinkProps />

## Skip Link Content Props

<SkipLinkContentProps />

export default props => <ScopeableLayout {...props} components={{ Button }} />;
