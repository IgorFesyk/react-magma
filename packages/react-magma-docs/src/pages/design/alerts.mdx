Alerts are used to provide action-based feedback messages or to convey informational and/or critical account-related messages.

<Alert>I'm just here to tell you something totally not worth stressing over.</Alert>

## Usage
An alert displays an important, succinct message, and provides actions for users to address (or dismiss the banner).  They can be used to simply update the user on what’s happening and not interrupt their experience, or they can be very disruptive to emphasize what a user must do before they can continue.

### Frequency
Only one alert may be shown at a time.

## Principles

### Informational
Alerts provide updates on an app’s processes.

### Contextual
Alerts are placed in the most suitable area of the UI.

### Appropriately Interruptive
Banners are interruptive, but their level of interruption should match the information they contain and the context in which they appear.

## Standard Alert Blocks

Alerts are categorized into four types based on severity:

### Info
Provides non-urgent information related to a performed action, or used within a page to communicate completely neutral information.

<Alert>I'm just here to tell you something totally not worth stressing over.</Alert>

### Success
Indicates that an action processed successfully.

<Alert variant="success">Yay!  You did it!  Great job!</Alert>

### Warning
Indicates that something isn't quite right, but there wasn't an error.

<Alert variant="warning">Umm, something's not quite right here.</Alert>

### Error
Indicates that an error occurred within a page or in relation to an action the user just attempted.

<Alert variant="danger">Oh no, it's all gone horribly wrong!</Alert>

## Dismissable Alerts
Alerts may be dismissable by including a close button.

<Alert dismissable variant="info" onDismiss={()=>{}}>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</Alert>
<Alert dismissable variant="success" onDismiss={()=>{}}>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</Alert>
<Alert dismissable variant="warning" onDismiss={()=>{}}>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</Alert>
<Alert dismissable variant="danger" onDismiss={()=>{}}>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</Alert>
<span class="horizontal-spacer"></span>

<hr class="article-divider" />

## Alert Links
Links may be included in alerts and the appropriate styling will be automatically applied.  Due to the background colors, we use semi-bold text and underline to stand out from the rest of the message.

<Alert variant="info">Info Alert with <a href="#">linked text</a></Alert>
<Alert variant="success">Success Alert with <a href="#">linked text</a></Alert>
<Alert variant="warning">Warning Alert with <a href="#">linked text</a></Alert>
<Alert variant="danger">Danger Alert with <a href="#">linked text</a></Alert>
<span class="horizontal-spacer"></span>

## Toast Alerts
Toast alerts are shown at the bottom-left of the page and stay for 5 seconds, providing immediate feedback in response to a user action.  The time it takes for the alert to disappear automatically can be adjusted if necessary.
