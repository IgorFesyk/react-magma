This custom Babel plugin will help with optimization. This plugin will go through all of your `react-magma-dom` imports and get rid of any unnecessary imports. This will allow webpack to only put the necessary dependencies in your projects final build.

```sh
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-react-magma-dom
```

#### Configure the plugin in your Babel config
