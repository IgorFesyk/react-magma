# Getting Started with React Magma

Install the React Magma component library, and start using Cengage-themed, accessible components in your application. For more information, see the [Stash Repository](http://stash.corp.web:7990/projects/FRONT/repos/react-magma/browse).

## Installation

### Setup requirements

1. Your project needs to be running **React v16.5** or greater
2. Make sure you have a `.npmrc` file and are using http://nexus.mindtap.corp.web/content/groups/npm.group/ as your registry.

```sh
registry=http://nexus.mindtap.corp.web/content/groups/npm.group/
```

### Install the component library

Install the React Magma Component library with `npm`.

```sh
npm install --save react-magma-dom
```

Once the component library is installed, you may begin using React Magma components in your application.  It is highly recommended that you install the Babel plugin before using in production.

### Install the Babel Plugin

This custom Babel plugin will help with optimization. This plugin will go through all of your `react-magma-dom` imports and get rid of any unnecessary imports. This will allow webpack to only put the necessary dependencies in your projects final build.

#### Add the plugin as a dev dependency

```sh
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-react-magma-dom
```

#### Configure the plugin in your Babel config

In your `babel.config.js` file add `react-magma-dom` to your `plugins` array.

example `babel.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  presets: ['@babel/preset-react'],
  plugins: ['react-magma-dom'],
}
```
