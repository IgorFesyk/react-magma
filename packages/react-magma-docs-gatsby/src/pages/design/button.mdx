# Buttons
Buttons are clickable items used to perform an action.
## 1. Usage
Buttons communicate actions that users can take.

* Submit a form.
* Begin a new task.
* Trigger a new UI element to appear on the page.
* Specify a new or next step in a process.

## 2. Principles
### 2.1 Identifiable
Buttons should indicate that they can trigger an action.
### 2.2 Findable
Buttons should be easy to find among other elements, including other buttons.
### 2.3 Clear
A button’s action and state should be clear.

## 3. Types
1. Text button (low emphasis)
Text buttons are typically used for less important actions.
2. Outlined Button (medium emphasis)
Outlined buttons are used for more emphasis than text buttons due to the stroke.
3. Solid button (high emphasis)
Solid buttons have more emphasis, as they use use a color fill.

## 4. Anatomy
### 4.1 Text Label
Almost all buttons use text labels, which describe the action that will occur if a user taps a button.
#### 4.1.2 All caps or sentence case?
By default Magma uses all caps text labels. This is to distinguish the text label from surrounding text.

Text labels should always be short and have clear purpose.  If a button requires a text label with three or more words, try really hard to shorten it.  If you can’t, you may use sentence case to help reduce the size of the button’s footprint.  We recommend buttons using sentence case also have an outline or solid container, to help differentiate the button from the text around it.

*Sentence Case Rules*
1. Capitalize the first word of the label
2. Capitalize any proper nouns, names, etc.
3. Use lowercase for everything else.

### 4.2 Icon
You can place icons next to text labels to both clarify an action and call attention to a button.  If a text label is not used, an icon should be present to signify what the button does.

## 5. Sizes
Other than the standard sized buttons, there are two other sizes – Large and small.

*Large* buttons can be used in scenarios where space allows and you desire a much more prominent call to action.

*Small* buttons can be used in scenarios where you want less emphasis on some actions because there are other more prominent actions on the UI.  They can also be used when space is limited for the number of buttons you need.

*Minimum Width -* Buttons with extremely short labels like “OK” or “Save” are in danger of being very small, even though they may be the primary action.  To avoid this, all text buttons have a minimum of width of 5.625em (90px).  This does not apply to icon only buttons.

## 6. Button Colors
Color can help reinforce the type of action that a button will perform if tapped.  The default colors of Magma are carefully chosen to both fit Cengage branding guidelines, as well as meet the accessibility requirement for color contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.  If deviations to these colors are required, then you assume responsibility to meet accessibility requirements.

By default, a button using the *Primary* color should be used.  This includes outlined buttons.

If you can justify in your design that the button’s purpose is to create or do something positive, you may use the button using the *Success* color.  This includes outlined buttons.

If you can justify in your design that the button’s purpose is to destroy or remove something, you may use the button using the *Danger* color.  This includes outlined buttons.

If your button is going on a dark background, you can use any of the solid buttons, but the link and outline buttons won’t work well.  Adding the inverse class to the solid or link buttons will give you a new set of options to choose from that work well on dark backgrounds.

## 7. Button States
Buttons have clear states to provide feedback to the user.

### 7.1 Hover and Active
For the best scalability, we use pseudo elements as overlays with varying opacities so we don’t have to find specific color values for each state.  Solid buttons typically use a white overlay at 10% opacity (hover) and 25% opacity (active).  For outline buttons we use the color of the text label as the overlay at the same opacity levels.

### 7.2 Focus
It’s important for users to clearly see when the browser’s focus is on a button.  This is especially important for users who can’t use a mouse, but instead have to rely on a keyboard or other means for navigating through the elements on the page.  The default focus presentation built into the browsers are not consistent, and have varying success in visibility depending on what’s behind the button.  For this reason, we are putting our own custom focus effect on Magma buttons.

The dotted outline is 2px, and the color is #F2A900 ($accent06).  Both of these properties help ensure the outline is visible on both light and dark backgrounds.

## 8. Hierarchy and Placement
### 8.1 Hierarchy
#### 8.1.1 A single, prominent button
A layout should contain a single prominent button that makes it clear that other buttons have less visual importance in the hierarchy. This high-emphasis button commands the most attention.
#### 8.1.2 Other buttons
An app can show more than one button in a layout at a time, so a high-emphasis button can be accompanied by medium- and low-emphasis buttons that perform less important actions. When using multiple buttons, ensure the available state of one button doesn’t look like the disabled state of another.
### 8.2 Placement
Multiple button types can be used to express different emphasis levels.  When using buttons that are contextually connected to left-to-right content, the buttons should also be left aligned, with the most important action coming first.  When the buttons are positioned as actions for a larger context, like an entire modal or page, then the buttons will typically be right aligned, with the most important action on the far right.

---

## 9. Responsive Behavior
Button sizes and placements will sometimes need to change because of the size of the user’s screen.  CSS breakpoints should be determined based on need, instead of limited to a set of standard breakpoints.
