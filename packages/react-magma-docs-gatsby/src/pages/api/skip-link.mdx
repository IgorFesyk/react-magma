# Skip Link

Because the main content is often not the first thing on a page, it is valuable to provide a Skip Navigation link
to allow users who navigate via keyboard and/or screen reader to jump directly to the content.

The `SkipLink` component should be the first item in your page, positioned in the DOM before the navigation and the content.
Users will not see the component unless they are navigating by keyboard.

It is recommended to use only one skip link per page, and to keep it in a consistent location throughout the appliation.

## Basic Usage

The `targetID` property is required, and refers to the id of the main content area that will receive focus when the `SkipLink` is clicked.
If there is an h1 heading inside the target element, the h1 will receive focus.  Otherwise, the element with the `targetId` will receive focus.

```.jsx
    <SkipLink targetID='myID' />
```

## Button Text

By default, the text inside the button says "Skip Navigation".  This can be overriden using the `buttonText` prop.

```.jsx
    <SkipLink
        buttonText='Skip to main content'
        targetID='myID' />
```

## Positioning

By default, the `SkipLink` is fixed poistioned 10px from the top and 10px from left of the screen.  This can be customized using the optional `positionLeft`
and `positionTop` properties, which take numeric values.

```.jsx
    <SkipLink
        positionLeft={25}
        positionTop={25}
        targetID='myID' />
```

## Button Variations

By default, the `SkipLink` looks like a standard button with `color` as`primary`, `variant` as `solid`, and `inverse` as false.

Variants for buttons include `solid`, `outline`, and `link`.
Colors for buttons include `primary`, `secondary`, `success`, and `danger`.
Inverse is can be either `true` or `false`, and is used when the SkipLink is to appear on a dark background.

For more information, see the <Link to="/api/button">Button Component documentation</Link>.

```.jsx
    <SkipLink
        color="secondary"
        inverse
        variant="outline"
        targetID='myID' />
```
