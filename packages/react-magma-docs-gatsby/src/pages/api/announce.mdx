# Announce
When dynamically changing content on a page, it is important that all users become aware of these changes.  While changes may be visually apparent to users who cans see the page,
they may not be clear to users of assistive technology.  The `Announce` component uses the `aria-live` attribute to to expose dynamic content to those using screen readers.

## Basic Usage

```.jsx
    <Announce>
        The text that changes will be read by the screen reader.
    </Announce>
```

## Politeness

The `Announce` component takes an optional `politeness` prop, that accepts the following values: `assertive`, `off`, and `polite`.  The default value is `polite`.
This sets the value of the `aria-live` attribute and is used to set the priority with which screen reader should treat updates to live regions.

When `polite` is used, assistive technology will notify a users of a change after the current task is complete.  When `assertive` is used, assistive technologies will notify the user immediately,
possibly interrupting the current task.  Using `off` will silence these updates.

```.jsx
    <Announce politeness="assertive">
        This text can be read by a screen reader, but does not appear on the screen.
    </Announce>
```
