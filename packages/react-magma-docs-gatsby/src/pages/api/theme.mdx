# Theming

## Using Themes

By default, all components in the React Magma library use the Magma theme.  However, you can pass in an alternative theme using the `<ThemeContext.Provider>`,
and passing in your custom theme as the `value` property. Themes can be nested.

This example shows two demo components.  The first one is wrapped inside a `ThemeContext.Provider` with the value of `amgam`.
Inside that theme provider, is another `ThemeContext.Provider` with the value of `amgamDark`.

```.jsx
  <ThemeContext.Provider value={amgam}>
      <DemoComponent idPrefix="theme1" />
      <ThemeContext.Provider value={amgamDark}>
          <DemoComponent idPrefix="theme2" />
      </ThemeContext.Provider>
  </ThemeContext.Provider>
```
