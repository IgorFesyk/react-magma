# Global Styles

The `<<GlobalStyles />` component should be included at the top of your application to provide global css, including the required fonts,
body styles, and some generic styles for links and headings.  

The `GlobalStyles` component can be nested inside the `ThemeContext.Provivder` to inherit styles from the theme.

```.jsx
  <GlobalStyles />
```
