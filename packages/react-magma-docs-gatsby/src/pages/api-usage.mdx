# Using React Magma

How to use React Magma components.

## Basic Example

To use a component, simply import the component and add it to your UI. The styles are already bundled with the compoennt.
Here is a most basic example:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from 'react-magma-dom';
 
function Demo() {
  return (
    <Button>
      Hello World
    </Button>
  );
} 
```

## Importing Global Styles

## Adding Custom Styles to Components
